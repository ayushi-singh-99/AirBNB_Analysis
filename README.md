Conclusion:
Manhattan and Brooklyn have the highest demand and competition for Airbnb rentals, making them attractive but competitive areas for hosts. High prices in Manhattan reflect its tourist appeal, while Brooklyn offers more affordable options in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant. The majority of listings are for short-term stays, and entire homes or apartments are most common. Hosts may find lucrative opportunities in high-demand areas but face intense competition. Areas near the airport in Queens attract many short-term visitors due to their convenience and lower costs.
